# WSDM-Churn-Prediction-Challenge
In a subscription business, accurate prediction of
upgradation/continuing of existing subscription is a critical
prospective in terms of long term acumen and profitability
for the company. The slightest variation will affect a
commercial profit drastically. WSDM KKBoxâ€™s Churn
Prediction Challenge will help in increase the accuracy in
predictability of this business. This challenge helps us to
find an alternative/improvement from the current technique
(Survival analysis technique).


The project aims at formulating an algorithm which
will help in determining whether a user leaves/quits a
subscription, helping KKBOX to maintain the subscribed
users.

A detailed Report of the project is included
